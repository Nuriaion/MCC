Chunks
======


Create a zoomable structure with a flexible navigation system --> coordinates


Idea
----

Based on the concept from Minecraft, create a world made out of chunks. Contrary to 
Minecraft which uses a fixed 2-level approach, Chunks shall be n-level. This means 
that there will be hierarchy of chunks, down to the base size. It could go down
to sub-base size too. This would allow a game with a grow/shrink cabability.


Structure
---------

The most important step for this idea to get real is to define a data structure which
is flexible enough and an localisation scheme which can be extended.
